# Space-Fighters-GUI

##### DESCRIPTION #####
Simple shooter arcade game written in Java Swing.
The enemies are invading! It is your job to shoot them down before they reach your planet.
Your defences will cover up to 3 hits, after which the game will come to an end. 
Be careful! Enemies become impatient and begin to spawn more rapidly as time goes on!

##### INSTRUCTIONS #####
Shoot the enemies before they reach your base. Shooting costs ammo, which needs to be generated at a steady pace. 
Picking up Power Ups will add to your stock pile, and make it easier to stop the invaders. 

Power Ups are as follows:
  1. (L) Large - increases the size of your missle temporarily
  2. (T) Triple - increases the range of your missle temporarily
  3. (C) Clear - Allows you to contact base and send in an emergency airstrike. 

##### KEYS #####
1. Move around with the arrow keys.
2. Fire using the Space Bar.
3. Clear using the 'c' button.
